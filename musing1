The one who forgot to be

I fell and I didn't hit the ground
I fell and I kept on falling

As I fell, I saw the earth
Rich, mysterious and life nuturing
So beautiful  with layers deep and unknown

I saw the earth make no judgement about seeds planted or the planter
Accepting all and nuturing all

I saw the earth offer worship to be found worthy of the planter
I saw the earth celebrate with tears as the planter choose to acknowledge and accept her 

I pointed and said "But You are all powerful, you nuture life, you deserve to be worshipped "

In that moment I stopped falling as earth and I became one
The one that forgot to be
